# 2018 Agency Zero Front-End Starter Project v0.2

## About

A modern web-dev standard for AZ projects making use of:
- React/Redux for UI/state-management
- SASS (node-sass-chokidar)
- Enzyme/Jest for testing
- more to come...

A work in progress. This second iteration is formatted to communicate with the Wordpress REST API, updated for more robust dependency integration and React v16 support


## Instructions

- run 0react shell script to generate new project (if just cloned, specify new path to project in script)

- change project-specific variables
